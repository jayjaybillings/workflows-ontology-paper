\section{Conclusions: The Road Ahead}

This work describes the variety of workflows, technologies, problems, and
challenges commonly found in the workflow science space.  Self-evidently, no
single workflow management system will be able to address the next generation
of scientific challenges and practical experience dictates that a change is
necessary. We propose  that common Building Blocks are a promising and
practical solution. It proposes that a Building Blocks model solve problems of
system proliferation and interoperability by redeveloping common functionality
that exists in workflow management systems into reusable services.
