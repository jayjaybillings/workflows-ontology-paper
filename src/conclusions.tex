\section{Conclusions: The Road Ahead}

This work describes the variety of workflows, technologies, problems, and
challenges commonly found in the workflow science space. No
single workflow management system will be able to address the next generation
of scientific challenges, and practical experience dictates that a change is
necessary. We propose  that common building blocks are a promising and
practical solution. A building blocks model solve problems of
system proliferation and interoperability by redeveloping common functionality
that exists in workflow management systems into reusable services.
