\section{Conclusions: The Road Ahead}

This work describes the variety of workflows, technologies, problems, and
challenges commonly found in the workflow science space. It proposes that a
Building Blocks model solves problems with system proliferation and
interoperability by redeveloping common functionality that exists in workflow
management systems into reusable services. No single workflow management system
will be able to address the next generation of scientific challenges and
practical experience dictates that a change is necessary and that common
Building Blocks are a solution.
