\begin{abstract} \todo{This abstract is based on the one page document that we
sent to the future of scientific workflows document. I like the ideas, but it is
just a place holder. We should update as needed!}

Discussions on workflows and workflow management systems inevitably turn to
questions about the natures of those very subjects. What is a workflow? What is
a workflow management system? Surveying five papers will often give five
different definitions of both. This has led to what the Oak Ridge Leadership
Computing Facility's 2016 report refers to as ``the current proliferation of
workflow systems in response to perceived domain-specific needs of scientific
workflows.'' Many of these systems tend to be monolithic with few extension
mechanisms for those not fully versed in the existing code base, making reuse
and interoperability practically impossible. This paper examines this phenomenon
and proposes that the community should 1) focus on the development of common
building blocks that can be assembled into domain-specific workflow management
systems, and 2) that common building blocks are the best way to address workflow
management system interoperability. This examination is performed in light of
the growing need for ``workflow campaigns'' that execute workflows across
facilities, systems and workflow types.
