\begin{abstract}

The study of ``workflow science'' has an open secret: Discussions about workflows and workflow management systems inevitably turn into discussions about the nature of those very topics! Too often, surveying a number of papers will result in different definitions from each paper and a strong inconsistency that leaves the reader with a skewed opinion. This inconsistency often centers around the different between several different types of workflows, including grid, modeling and simulation, uncertainty quantification, and purely conceptual workflows. This work explores this phenomenon by examining the different types of workflows and workflow management systems, reviewing the perspective of a large supercomputing facility, examining the common features and problems of workflow management systems, and finally presenting a proposed solution based on the concept of common building blocks. The implications of the continuing proliferation of workflow management systems and the lack of interoperability between these systems are discussed from a practical perspective.
