\begin{itemize}
\item I feel like the goal here needs to be to really setup why we think that 1) we have a problem, 2) why interoperability matters, and 3) why building blocks are the solution. I like that laying it out that way gives us two problems and then one solution.
\item We need to unpack the ideal of interoperability into all of the different types.
\item experiments - can we do something around ICE?
\item Can we validate conceptual ideas by getting others involved to come up with building block types? What are the 5,6,10,...,n building blocks? Need them to tell us *why* these are building blocks for them!
\end{itemize}

Table 1 is a very simple set of rows where the first column would just be the name of the building block - carefully thought out - and the description of the block. Need to assign a function description to the component. ($n \times 2$)

Table 2 has building blocks as the rows and the columns are the WMSes. ($n \times m$)

Let $n = 6$, as the initial building block number.
Launch
AAA
Data management storage services
Reproducibility and provenance
Service/Programming/Execution/Deployment model - how are the blocks exposed to the end user

\textbf{Bring back notes on other building blocks! Look at ORNL list.}

Try to pick dates to go see Shantenu and finish the paper. 23rd-24th-25th of May work best for Shantenu. Maybe the previous week?

Vertical integration = extensibility
Horizontal integration = interoperability

Building blocks - functional vs. non-functional. So provenance removed from the list below.

{\bf First cut at all lists combined}

These are neither necessary nor sufficient building blocks, but they have represent the landscape.


\begin{itemize}
\item Functional
\begin{enumerate}
\item File and Meta-data Management
\item Execution Engine - Responsible for executing and controlling workflows, tasks, and subprocesses of tasks.
\item Resource Management and Acquisition - Historically includes compute, data, and network, but now includes web services and in-situ modification in menu and in-transit computing.
\item Task management - Responsible for managing the states that the tasks might be in.
\item Monitoring - Includes execution and performance monitoring of things executed by the execution engine. (Consuming building block.)
\item Logging and information - Responsible for providing services for producing information that is consumed by logs and monitors. (Producer building block.)
\end{enumerate}
\item Non-Functional
\begin{enumerate}
\item API 
\item Developer Tools (?)
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

What about viz?
