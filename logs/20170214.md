If we go with my three point idea that a fresh impetus towards an ontology, interoperatibility and building blocks is necessary:
* We need to argue why ontologies are necessary and how they are an improvement over taxonomies.
* We need to have a critical perspective on interoperability and why current efforts have failed. What are we now saying that is different from what they proposed?
* How does this relate to building blocks? Are the building blocks a software basis? Or also conceptual as well? We need to clarify this.

Building blocks are a way to achieve implicit interoperatibility, but this breaks from a practical perspective since people come at it from different perspectives (i.e. - system versus application, for example). So the discussion needs to be managed somewhat carefully.
